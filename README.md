# Cses-Tree-algorithms-
Most of the solutions are direct implementations of simple algortihms easily available on https://usaco.guide/general or https://cp-algorithms.com/


Basic Algorithms used:
a)simple dfs on trees
b)Topological sorting 
c)Euler tour and tree flatenning
d)Heavy Light Decomposition
e)Small to large Merging
f)Centroid decomposition



Most of the solutions are writtenn in almost similar format so if u can give some time to understand any one of them following the other solutions  shouldn't be that hard.
